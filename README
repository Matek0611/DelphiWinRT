This is a sample WinRT app written in Delphi. 

Winapi.Winrt and Winapi.Winrt_1 represent incomplete translations of headers
from the Windows 8 Developer Preview SDK. 

System.WinrtHelpers represents incomplete helper classes that attempt to make
working with native WinRT types simpler.

Use at your own risk.

NOTE: the dproj has a post build event configured that executes deploy.bat
deploy.bat assumes you have a certificate installed that is capable of signing
code. It also needs to be modified to check for your signature's publisher
(presumably, you on a development machine). Also, the AppxManifest needs to
be updated with the correct publisher information as well. Deployment is 
unnecessary to run in windowed mode: deployment can be ommitted by removing
the post-build event in the project options.
